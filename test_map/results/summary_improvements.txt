=== MAP IMPROVEMENT SUMMARY (RELATIVE TO MAP 0) ===

Baseline (Map 0) values:
Global IoU: 0.9959 (99.59%)
ROI IoU: 0.9881 (98.81%)
Global Recall: 99.59%
ROI Recall: 98.81%

Maximum possible improvement from baseline:
Global IoU: 0.41%
ROI IoU: 1.19%
Global Recall: 0.41%
ROI Recall: 1.19%

RELATIVE IMPROVEMENTS (Percentage of potential improvement):
Map Name, Global IoU Improvement (%), ROI IoU Improvement (%), Global Recall Improvement (%), ROI Recall Improvement (%)
map_0, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
map_cleaned_map_1, -31.31, -12.16, 7.31, 20.64
map_cleaned_map_2, -49.31, -3.28, 11.46, 38.60
map_cleaned_map_3, -52.61, -2.11, 15.82, 43.53
map_cleaned_map_4, -44.08, 3.61, 29.32, 52.58
map_cleaned_map_5, -26.65, 15.33, 48.95, 65.77

EXPLANATION:
- Relative Improvements: How much of the potential improvement from baseline to perfect score has been achieved
- 0% means same performance as baseline (Map 0)
- 100% means perfect score achieved (IoU=1.0 or Recall=100%)
- Negative values indicate degradation compared to baseline

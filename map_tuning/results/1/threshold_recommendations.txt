=== THRESHOLD RECOMMENDATIONS ===

Based on the analysis of confidence values in misclassified cells, the following thresholds are recommended:

reduce_false_positives: 14
reduce_false_negatives: 1
balanced: 7
verification_threshold: 3

Recommendation summary:
For a balanced approach, we recommend:
- confidence_threshold: 7
- verification_threshold: 3

These recommendations aim to balance the tradeoff between reducing false positives and false negatives.
Adjust these values based on whether you prioritize map completeness (lower threshold) or accuracy (higher threshold).


=== GRID SEARCH RECOMMENDATION ===

Based on exhaustive grid search, the optimal thresholds are:
- confidence_threshold: 1
- verification_threshold: 3
